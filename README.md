#### Introduction 
A chatbot is software that simulates human-like conversations with users via text messages on chat. 
Its key task is to help users by providing answers to their customers. 
It is to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent. 

#### Objective 
The objective of the current chatbot is to assist customers in booking their orders in mere 3 steps. 
Generally, it is difficult for elderly citizens to go to pharmacies and get their medicines. 
To ease their difficulty, e-commerce sites have been ordering the prescribed medicines at their doorstep. 
Thus, to make the process even simpler, a chatbot has been introduced where typing in name and pincode is the only task for users. 
A fictitious company named PharmLife has a chatbot on their website named PharmTalk. 

#### Methodology 
Google Dialogflow is used for making the chatbot.
The questions are simple.
The intents have been clearly mentioned.
A total of 7 intents were made, defining parameters wherever necessary.
