#### Summary
Taylor Swift is a famous pop-star and I scraped tweets using twitter API on the hashtag #taylorswift. I carried out a sentiment analysis on these tweets and the results, interpretations were very interesting. one of the insights were the tickets of concert ERAS tour,I can inferred that the organization that is selling tickets for the concert “TicketMaster” has been in bad press, and the issues faced by desperate fans who were tweeting out.

Google Dialogflow is used for making the chatbot.
The questions are simple.
The intents have been clearly mentioned.
A total of 7 intents were made, defining parameters wherever necessary.
